# Eat Da Burger

## About the Project
The purpose of this project was to create a full-stack app using SQL and Handlebars. The user can save a list of burgers and mark them off as eaten. Sort of a todo-list application with a creative spin. The app does not have full CRUD functionality but does have routes for Create, Read, and Update.
